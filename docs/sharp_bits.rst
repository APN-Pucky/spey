Sharp Bits
==========

In this section we will discuss important but somewhat overlooked features of the software to 
allow for smooth execution.

Optimisation
------------

Spey relies on optimisation of parameter of interest and nuisance parameters, :math:`\mu` and 
:math:`\theta` through out the software to find optimal values for log-likelihood distribution.
